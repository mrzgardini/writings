Volodymyr Korniichuk heads security at Diia, an app used by 20m Ukrainians that contains their ID card and other documents and lets them pay taxes, get social-security payments and so on. “There hasn’t been a week when we have not been under attack,” he says. Behind one Russian operation a company was discovered that had been incorporated two weeks before the invasion. It was traced to an address of a company registered in London.

In December, in the biggest single successful strike of the war, Russian hackers took down Kyivstar, Ukraine’s largest mobile and internet provider, shutting down services for several days. Standing in front of a large screen, Major Yurii Myronenko, head of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP), points at graphs detailing who was responsible. SSSCIP comes under the security services, so he is in uniform. It is also at the centre of a galaxy of state, military and private cyber-defence outfits and helps co-ordinate them all. There were 2,194 “cyber incidents” in 2022, he says, of which 1,048 were “major or critical”. In 2023 there were 2,554, of which only 367 were serious. So Ukraine’s cyber defenders have drastically reduced the rate of serious attacks. But in the first two months of this year the Russians stepped it up, and he expects 2024 to be “even harder in terms of cyber warfare”.

He says the SSSCIP has learned that 10% of attacks come from cyber units of the Russian security services, while the rest come from affiliated criminal hacker groups and others. The single most effective Russian cyber unit is called Armageddon, which belongs to the FSB security service. Some of its personnel are said to be ex-members of the Ukrainian security services in Crimea who defected to Russia when the peninsula was annexed in 2014.
