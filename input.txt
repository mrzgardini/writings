Solving a 112-bit Prime Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem on Game Consoles using Sloppy Reduction https://www.joppebos.com/files/noan112.pdf

We describe a Cell processor implementation of Pollardâ€™s rho method to solve discrete logarithms in groups of elliptic curves over prime fields. The implementation was used on a cluster of PlayStation 3 game consoles to set a new record. We present in detail the underlying single instruction multiple data modular arithmetic.
