Healthier, cleaner, greener: a NATO strategy for the coming bio-revolution https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2024/05/30/healthier-cleaner-greener-a-nato-strategy-for-the-coming-bio-revolution/index.html

Biotechnology refers to the broad technology area that uses biological processes, cells or cellular compounds to develop new products and technologies. Human enhancement technologies are the biotechnological and non-biotechnological interventions that enable individuals to operate beyond normal human limits or abilities. 

Key considerations in the responsible use of human enhancement technologies include reversibility and invasiveness. Reversible interventions (such as stimulants like caffeine) are time-limited, whereas irreversible ones (such as permanent prosthetic limbs) are not. Further, there are differences between invasive interventions (such as having a pacemaker) versus non-invasive ones (like having bio-sensors integrated into uniforms). Ethical quandaries associated with these characteristics are nuanced. Not all permanent enhancements are undesirable. For instance, those that undergo laser eye surgery typically hope that it lasts. Therefore, while reversibility and invasiveness provide guardrails for ethical discussions around human enhancement technologies, they should still be considered in terms of risk with duty of care guiding all decisions.
