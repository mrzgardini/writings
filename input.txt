Sparse Pseudo-Random Graphs are Hamiltonian https://annas-archive.org/md5/84abac66dd06bf30d0a2d0e66c215973

In this article we study Hamilton cycles in sparse pseudo-random graphs. We prove that if the second largest absolute value Î» of an eigenvalue of a d-regular graph G on n vertices satisfies
$$\lambda \le \frac{(\log \log n)^2}{1000 \log n (\log \log \log n)}d$$
and n is large enough, then G is Hamiltonian. We also show how our main result can be used to prove that for every c >0 and large enough n a Cayley graph X (G,S), formed by choosing a set S of c log5 n random generators in a group G of order n, is almost surely Hamiltonian.
