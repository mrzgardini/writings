“Large scale behaviour of interacting diffusions: from stochastic control to functional inequalities” https://www.math.unipd.it/news/large-scale-behaviour-of-interacting-diffusions-from-stochastic-control-to-functional-inequalities/

The goal of the workshop is to discuss recent advances on the study of asymptotic properties of interacting particle systems, with a special emphasis on controlled systems. Topics of interest include but are not limited to propagation of chaos, infinite dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations and ergodicity. We also aim at fostering discussions on the interplay between control methods and other emerging techniques to establish functional inequalities.
