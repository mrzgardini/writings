The "Feynman Technique" is a distillation of his approach to learning and problem-solving, which can be summarized as follows:

Write down the problem: Clearly define the problem you're trying to solve.
Teach it to a child: Explain the problem and your solution in simple terms, as if you were teaching a child.
Identify the gaps: Identify the areas where you're not sure or don't understand.
Review and refine: Review your explanation, refine your understanding, and fill in the gaps.
