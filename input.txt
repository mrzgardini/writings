This package provides a lean implementation of Morlet wavelets designed for power-spectral analysis of M/EEG resting-state signals.
Distinct frequency-domain parametrization of Morlet wavelets.
Established spectral M/EEG metrics share same wavelet convolutions.
Harmonized & tested Python and MATLAB implementation numerically equivalent.
Comprehensive mathematical documentation.
