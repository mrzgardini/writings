Using string theory to solve old problems in mathematics

In the world of geometry, mathematicians study surfaces which help bridge abstract theory with the real-world.

Among the surfaces that are interesting to scientists and mathematicians, ‘K3 surfaces’ stand out as particularly fascinating. Named after three mathematicians – Ernst Kummer, Kunihiko Kodaira, and Erich Kähler – and after the mountain K2, K3 surfaces have properties that are rather unique.
