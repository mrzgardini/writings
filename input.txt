Beating bird flu with maths https://plus.maths.org/content/beating-bird-flu-0
Even in the absence of high-quality data, mathematical models can identify major risk factors and give qualitative predictions.
Farms were also classified to account for other factors that may impact the risk of transmission, for example the species of birds they housed and whether those birds were kept for their eggs or their meat.
As far as the risk to humans is concerned, Sharkey hopes that models designed to understand the spread among poultry will provide important clues. The idea is to derive risk factors for different sectors of the industry. Seeing how many people in a sector regularly come into close contact with the animals, researchers may then be able to estimate the chance of human infection.
