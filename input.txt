Lattice physics approaches for neural networks. <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12022'>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12022</a>.

Modern neuroscience has evolved into a frontier field that draws on numerous disciplines, resulting in the flourishing of novel conceptual frames primarily inspired by physics and complex systems science. Contributing in this direction, we recently introduced a mathematical framework to describe the spatiotemporal interactions of systems of neurons using lattice field theory, the reference paradigm for theoretical particle physics. In this note, we provide a concise summary of the basics of the theory, aiming to be intuitive to the interdisciplinary neuroscience community. We contextualize our methods, illustrating how to readily connect the parameters of our formulation to experimental variables using well-known renormalization procedures. This synopsis yields the key concepts needed to describe neural networks using lattice physics. Such classes of methods are attention-worthy in an era of blistering improvements in numerical computations, as they can facilitate relating the observation of neural activity to generative models underpinned by physical principles.
