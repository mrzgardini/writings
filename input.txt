New Computational Model of Real Neurons Could Lead to Better AI https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2024/06/24/new-computational-model-of-real-neurons-could-lead-to-better-ai/
A new model developed at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Neuroscience (CCN) suggests that this decades-old approximation doesn’t capture all the computational abilities that real neurons possess and that this older model is potentially holding back AI development.
