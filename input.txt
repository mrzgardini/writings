Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients for which we are interested in finding integer solutions. These equations are named after Diophantus of Alexandria, a third century Greek mathematician, who was interested in finding out whether these equations were soluble in integers.
These equations have held mathematiciansâ€™ interest ever since. In 1900, David Hilbert outlined 23 problems to shape the future of mathematics. The tenth of these was to provide an algorithm, to decide whether a Diophantine equation is solvable in integers.
In 1970, Matiyasevich proved that a general algorithm was not possible, and now researchers try to solve specific classes of equations.
